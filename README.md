Executive Summary
My project will be about legislators’ voting records in the context of their respective shares held. It will provide voters with an intuitive tool to learn information about their representatives’ voting records compared against financial ties or interests tied up in legislation. I aim to take public voting records and visualize correlations between those voting records and pertinent information that can inform voters.
This will highlight any overlap between senators’ votes and the stocks they own which that legislation might affect. I hope that in using this resource, a voter will be able to extract instances where a representative could have enacted legislation under the influence of financial bias.

Motivation
I regard voter literacy as one of the most important pillars of a healthy and equitable democracy. I’ve also noticed that information about voting records, as well as information about financial connections that introduce bias into the legislation, tends to be scant or not easily digestible. I hope to close that information gap and help produce interactive data visualizations that can be used to elucidate voters’ choices. My aim is to continue developing this resource (including long after having submitted this project as the capstone to the program I'm enrolled) and have it be used by voters as well as people looking to become more informed about their representatives’ decisions.

Data Question
Is it possible to use statistical analysis to identify financial bias or hidden interests among lawmakers? For example, if a voter learns of a decision made by their representative which seems to not be in their best interest, then that voter can at a glance look up any public records about stock owned by that representative.

Included in the project:
- All the code used for collecting, cleaning, and organizing the data in the form of Python notebooks
- A PowerPoint presentation outlining my data acquisition methodology along with thoughts on how the project might continue to evolve
- A Tableau presentation that provides an insightful way of looking into the data

Known Issues and Challenges
This project finds correlations between senators' voting records and stocks they own. This is a difficult correlation to ascertain (see PowerPoint for methods used in accomplishing this) -- for example, what statistical corollary could be possibly be used for deciding that a piece of legislation will for certain impact any given stock's growth/decline? And even if we were to find such a corollary, to what degree are they impacted? Legislation affects the free market in many different ways, and so the scope of this resource must be understood for proper use. Data points derived from the analysis aren't meant to ascribe any specific motivation to the senator in question; rather, correctly interpreted insights necessarily imply only the potential for bias and a correlations between legislation and the markets they may change.
